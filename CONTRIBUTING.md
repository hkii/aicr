## Design Principles

These principles guide all design decisions in Eidos. When faced with trade-offs, these principles take precedence.

### Local Development Equals CI

The same tools, same versions, and same validation run locally and in CI.

**What:** Tool versions are centralized in `.versions.yaml`. Both `make tools-setup` (local) and GitHub Actions use this single source of truth. `make qualify` runs the exact same checks as CI.

**Why:** "Works on my machine" is not acceptable. If a contributor can run `make qualify` locally and it passes, CI will pass. This eliminates surprise failures and reduces feedback loops.

### Correctness Must Be Reproducible

Given the same inputs, the same system version must always produce the same result.

**What:** No hidden state, no implicit defaults, no non-deterministic behavior. A recipe generated from a snapshot today must be identical to one generated from the same snapshot tomorrow.

**Why:** Reproducibility is a prerequisite for debugging, validation, and trust. If users can't reproduce a result, they can't trust it.

### Metadata Is Separate from Consumption

Validated configuration exists independent of how it is rendered, packaged, or deployed.

**What:** Recipes define *what* is correct. Bundlers and deployers determine *how* to deliver it (Helm, ArgoCD, raw manifests). The recipe doesn't change based on the deployment mechanism.

**Why:** This prevents tight coupling of correctness to a specific tool, workflow, or delivery mechanism. Users can adopt new deployment tools without re-validating their configurations.

### Recipe Specialization Requires Explicit Intent

More specific recipes are never matched unless explicitly requested. Generic intent cannot silently resolve to specialized configurations.

**What:** If a user requests a "training" recipe, they get the training configuration. The system never silently upgrades to a more specific variant (e.g., "training-distributed-horovod") without explicit opt-in.

**Why:** This prevents accidental misconfiguration and preserves user control. Surprises in infrastructure configuration are dangerous.

### Trust Requires Verifiable Provenance

Trust is established through evidence, not assertions. Every released artifact carries verifiable proof of origin and build process.

**What:** All releases include SLSA Build Level 3 provenance, SBOM attestations, and Sigstore signatures. Users can verify exactly which commit, workflow, and build produced any artifact.

**Why:** This underpins supply-chain security, compliance, and confidence. "Trust us" is not a security model.

### Adoption Comes from Idiomatic Experience

The system integrates into how users already work. We provide validated configuration, not a new operational model.

**What:** Eidos outputs standard formats (Helm values, Kubernetes manifests) that work with existing tools (kubectl, ArgoCD, Flux). Users don't need to learn "the Eidos way" of deploying.

**Why:** If adoption requires retraining users on a new workflow, our design has failed. Value comes from correctness, not from lock-in.

## Development Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/eidos.git
cd eidos
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure you have:

- **Go**: Version 1.25 or higher ([download](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **make**: For build automation (pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- **git**: For version control

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The project includes a setup script that installs all required development tools with versions managed centrally in `.versions.yaml`. This ensures consistency between local development and CI environments.

```bash
# Install all required tools (interactive mode)
make tools-setup

# Verify all tools are installed with correct versions
make tools-check
```

Example `make tools-check` output:

```
=== Tool Version Check ===

Tool                 Expected        Installed       Status
----                 --------        ---------       ------

Legend: ✓ = installed, ⚠ = version mismatch, ✗ = missing
```

### Version Management

All tool versions are centrally managed in `.versions.yaml`. This file is the single source of truth used by:
- `make tools-setup` - Local development setup
- `make tools-check` - Version verification
- GitHub Actions CI - Ensures CI uses identical versions

When updating tool versions, edit `.versions.yaml` and the changes propagate everywhere automatically.

### Alternative: Using Flox

If you prefer a fully reproducible environment without installing tools globally, you can use [Flox](https://flox.dev/):

```bash
# Install Flox (https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/)
# Then activate the development environment
flox activate

# Optional: Enable auto-activation with direnv
direnv allow
```

Flox provides all tools in an isolated environment that won't affect your system.

### Finalize Setup

After installing tools (via either method):

```bash
# Download Go module dependencies
make tidy

# Verify everything is ready
make tools-check

# Run full qualification to ensure setup is correct
make qualify
```

## Project Architecture

### Key Components

#### CLI (`eidos`)
- **Location**: `cmd/eidos/main.go` → `pkg/cli/`
- **Framework**: [urfave/cli v3](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
- **Commands**: `snapshot`, `recipe`
- **Purpose**: User-facing tool for system snapshots and recipe generation (supports both query and snapshot modes)
- **Output**: Supports JSON, YAML, and table formats

#### API Server
- **Location**: `cmd/eidosd/main.go` → `pkg/server/`, `pkg/api/`
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /v1/recipe` - Generate configuration recipes
  - `GET /health` - Liveness probe
  - `GET /ready` - Readiness probe
  - `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- **Purpose**: HTTP service for recipe generation with rate limiting and observability
- **Deployment**: http://localhost:8080

#### Collectors
- **Location**: `pkg/collector/`
- **Pattern**: Factory-based with dependency injection
- **Types**: 
  - **SystemD**: Service states (containerd, docker, kubelet)
  - **OS**: 4 subtypes - grub, sysctl, kmod, release
  - **Kubernetes**: Node info, server version, images, ClusterPolicy
  - **GPU**: Hardware info, driver version, MIG settings
- **Purpose**: Parallel collection of system configuration data
- **Context Support**: All collectors respect context cancellation

#### Recipe Engine
- **Location**: `pkg/recipe/`
- **Purpose**: Generate optimized configurations using base-plus-overlay model
- **Modes**:
  - **Query Mode**: Direct recipe generation from system parameters
  - **Snapshot Mode**: Extract query from snapshot → Build recipe → Return recommendations
- **Input**: OS, OS version, kernel, K8s service/version, GPU type, workload intent
- **Output**: Recipe with matched rules and configuration measurements
- **Data Source**: Embedded YAML configuration (`recipe/data/overlays/*.yaml` including `base.yaml`)
- **Query Extraction**: Parses K8s, OS, GPU measurements from snapshots to construct recipe queries

#### Snapshotter
- **Location**: `pkg/snapshotter/`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate parallel collection of system measurements
- **Output**: Complete snapshot with metadata and all collector measurements
- **Usage**: CLI command, Kubernetes Job agent
- **Format**: Structured snapshot (eidos.nvidia.com/v1alpha1)

#### Bundler Framework
- **Location**: `pkg/bundler/`
- **Pattern**: Registry-based with pluggable bundler implementations
- **API**: Object-oriented with functional options (DefaultBundler.New())
- **Purpose**: Generate deployment bundles from recipes (Helm values, K8s manifests, scripts)
- **Features**:
  - Template-based generation with go:embed
  - Functional options pattern for configuration (WithBundlerTypes, WithFailFast, WithConfig, WithRegistry)
  - **Parallel execution** (all bundlers run concurrently)
  - Empty bundlerTypes = all registered bundlers (dynamic discovery)
  - Fail-fast or error collection modes
  - Prometheus metrics for observability
  - Context-aware execution with cancellation support
  - **Value overrides**: CLI `--set bundler:path.to.field=value` allows runtime customization
  - **Node scheduling**: `--system-node-selector`, `--accelerated-node-selector`, and toleration flags for workload placement
- **Extensibility**: Implement `Bundler` interface and self-register in init() to add new bundle types

## Tips for Contributors

### First-Time Contributors

**Recommended starting points:**
1. Start with issues labeled `good first issue`
2. Read existing code in the package you're modifying (required before writing)
3. Run `make tools-check` to verify your environment matches expected versions
4. Study the [Design Principles](#design-principles) section before writing code

**Before writing any code:**
```bash
# 1. Verify your setup
make tools-check

# 2. Read existing code in the target package
# Look for patterns: error handling, context usage, test structure

# 3. Run tests to understand expected behavior
go test -v ./pkg/<package>/... -run TestSpecific
```

**Common first-contribution areas:**
- Documentation improvements (typos, clarifications)
- Adding test cases to existing tests
- Improving error messages with better context
- Adding debug logging to collectors

### Writing Good Commit Messages

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain the problem being solved and why this approach was chosen.

- Bullet points are fine
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123" or "Related to #456"

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
